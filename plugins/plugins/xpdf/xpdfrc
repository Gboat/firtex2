#========================================================================
#
# Sample xpdfrc file
#
# The Xpdf tools look for a config file in two places:
# 1. ~/.xpdfrc
# 2. in a system-wide directory, typically /usr/local/etc/xpdfrc
#
# This sample config file demonstrates some of the more common
# configuration options.  Everything here is commented out.  You
# should edit things (especially the file/directory paths, since
# they'll likely be different on your system), and uncomment whichever
# options you want to use.  For complete details on config file syntax
# and available options, please see the xpdfrc(5) man page.
#
# Also, the Xpdf language support packages each include a set of
# options to be added to the xpdfrc file.

#----- display fonts

# These map the Base-14 fonts to the Type 1 fonts that ship with
# ghostscript.  You'll almost certainly want to use something like
# this, but you'll need to adjust this to point to wherever
# ghostscript is installed on your system.  (But if the fonts are
# installed in a "standard" location, xpdf will find them
# automatically.)


# If you need to display PDF files that refer to non-embedded fonts,
# you should add one or more fontDir options to point to the
# directories containing the font files.  Xpdf will only look at .pfa,
# .pfb, and .ttf files in those directories (other files will simply
# be ignored).

#fontDir		/usr/local/fonts/bakoma

#----- PostScript output control

# Set the default PostScript file or command.

#psFile			"|lpr -Pmyprinter"

# Set the default PostScript paper size -- this can be letter, legal,
# A4, or A3.  You can also specify a paper size as width and height
# (in points).

#psPaperSize		letter

#----- text output control

# Choose a text encoding for copy-and-paste and for pdftotext output.
# The Latin1, ASCII7, and UTF-8 encodings are built into Xpdf.  Other
# encodings are available in the language support packages.

#textEncoding		UTF-8
textEncoding		GBK

# Choose the end-of-line convention for multi-line copy-and-past and
# for pdftotext output.  The available options are unix, mac, and dos.

#textEOL		unix

#----- misc settings

# Enable t1lib, FreeType, and anti-aliased text.

enableT1lib		yes
enableFreeType		yes
#antialias		yes

# Set the command used to run a web browser when a URL hyperlink is
# clicked.

#urlCommand	"netscape -remote 'openURL(%s)'"
